In celestial mechanics, the Lagrange points (also \textbf{Lagrangian points} or \textbf{libration points}) are points of equilibrium for small-mass objects under the influence of two massive orbiting bodies. Mathematically, this involves the solution of the restricted \emph{three-body problem} in which two bodies are far more massive than the third.

Normally, the two massive bodies exert an \underline{unbalanced} gravitational force at a point, altering the orbit of whatever is at that point. At the Lagrange points, the gravitational forces of the two large bodies and the centrifugal force \underline{balance} each other. This can make Lagrange points an excellent location for satellites, as few orbit corrections are needed to maintain the desired orbit.
